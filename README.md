# SASS-SUIT-UTILS

Base.css and all of the SUIT utilities respectfully ported from CSS4 to SASS modules

### SUIT

SUIT is an HTML/CSS framework for creating loosely coupled UI components, 
originally created by Nicolas Gallagher

SUIT also provides a collection of small, adaptive, structural HTML/CSS modules
built using a naming convention inspired by the BEM methodology.

### _base.scss

Base styles for web applications. Provides a thin layer on top of
[Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css). Removes default
margins and exposes variables for theming.

## Configurable variables

* `$background-base`: the application background style.
* `$color-base`: the root text color.
* `$font-base`: the root font style.
* `$link-color-base`: the root link color.
* `$link-color-hover-base`: the root link interaction (`:hover`, `:focus`,
  `:active`) color.
